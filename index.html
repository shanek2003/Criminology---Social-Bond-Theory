<h1 class="auto-style4"><strong>Social Control Theory - Travis Hirschi (1969)</strong></h1>
<p class="auto-style5">To start off: This is a control theory which examines why 
people DON’T commit crime. It is under the assumption that all people are law 
violators, but there is something that makes one refrain from committing crime. <o:p></o:p>
</p>
<p class="auto-style6">According to Hirschi, criminal/deviant behavior occur 
when an individual’s bonds to society are weak or broken. Strong ties to 
society, such as school, work, and family lead to societal conformity. Social 
bonds are broken into four elements: Attachment, Commitment, Involvement, and 
Belief. Individuals’ likelihood of participation in deviant/criminal behavior 
increases when one of these bonds are broken or weakened. <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="auto-style6"><span class="auto-style7"><strong>
<span class="auto-style13">Attachment </span>-</strong></span><span class="auto-style9"> 
According to Hirschi, when individuals have close ties with school, family, 
friends, and community they are more likly to have respect towards themselves 
and their attachments. They do not want to ruin relationships by being deviant.

<p><strong><span class="auto-style10">Commitment </span>
<span class="auto-style5">- </span></strong><span class="auto-style6">When 
people participate in conventional activities, such as school, work, and goals 
for future success, they may not want to jeopardize their future. They are 
commited to their goals, work, school, etc.

<p><strong><span class="auto-style11">Involvement</span><span class="auto-style6"><span class="auto-style13"> 
-</span> </span></strong><span class="auto-style6">Commitment to activities such 
as sports, extracarricular activities, school and work takes up a lot of time. 
Involvement in these activties leave little time for any criminal activties. 
When one has nothing to do, on the other hand, they have time to partcipate in 
deviant/criminal acts. Conventional activites isolate people from doing the 
wrong thing. </span></p>

<p><strong><span class="auto-style12">Belief -</span><span class="auto-style6">
</span></strong><span class="auto-style6">Holding strong moral values, religious 
beliefs instill a commitment to believing in societal rules and norms. 
Individuals who hold strong morals and religious beliefs are more likely to 
conform to societal rules and less likely to engage in deviant/criminal 
behavior. </span></p>

<p class="auto-style6"><span class="auto-style17"><strong>Beliefs</strong></span> 
are taught by <span class="auto-style14"><strong>ATTACHMENTS</strong></span>, 
reinforced by <span class="auto-style15"><strong>COMMITMENTS</strong></span> and
