# Criminology---Social-Bond-Theory
this is a short quiz and website that will tell us about social bond theory
# For the UnPaper final project, I was planning on by a website that will relate to Hirschi’s social bond theory. The idea is to have a QR code that will be scanned to access the site. This website will explain the main ideas behind Hirschi’s social bond theory. The theory contains four different bonds, so each bond will have its own section within the site. 
# It will effectively explain each one of the bonds (Attachment, Commitment, Involvement, and Belief). The site will ensure that the users understand that if one of the bonds are broken, then there is a higher likelihood of criminal or deviant behavior.
# Additionally, there will be a section on the site that allows users to take a quiz. The quiz will ask short questions about the users personal life, and at the end it will produce results. The results will tell the user their likelihood of engaging in deviant behavior.
